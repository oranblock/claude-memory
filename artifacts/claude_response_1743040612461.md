I've created a perfected capture function that addresses all the issues with file types and naming! Here's what this final version does:
Improvements in File Naming

Better Language Detection:

Detects languages from code content patterns
Recognizes class prefixes like "javascriptCopy" and removes them
Uses code block class names (language-*)
Includes an extensive language-to-extension mapping


Smart Filename Generation:

Extracts filenames from headings above code blocks
Finds filenames in comments (// filename.js, # data_processor.py)
Creates meaningful names from code content (class names, table names)
Generates appropriate filenames based on code patterns


Correct Extensions:

Ensures all files have the proper extension for their language
Preserves the correct extension when one is detected
Adds extensions to files that don't have them



Implementation Steps

Replace your current captureResponse() function with this new one
Save and reload your server
Use the bookmarklet to load the updated script
Try the capture command on a new artifact

Now when you run the capture command, you should get properly named files with correct extensions, making it much easier to organize and use the saved code.
This completes the Claude Memory system with all the features we set out to build! You now have a powerful tool for saving, organizing, and retrieving content from your conversations with Claude.
