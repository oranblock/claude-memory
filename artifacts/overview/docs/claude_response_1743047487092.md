I've created a comprehensive project structure for a modern full-stack web application called "TaskFlow." This structure follows industry best practices for organization, scalability, and maintainability.
Project Overview
TaskFlow is a complete task management system with:

User authentication and authorization
Task creation, editing, and filtering
Priority and category management
Due date tracking with notifications
Responsive design for all devices
Comprehensive testing suite
Containerized deployment

The architecture is designed with a clear separation of concerns, using React for the frontend, Express/Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.
Key Technical Components

Frontend Infrastructure

React with TypeScript for type safety
Context API for state management
Reusable UI component system
Comprehensive form validation
Testing with React Testing Library


Backend Architecture

Express.js with TypeScript
Controller-Service-Repository pattern
JWT authentication with secure cookie storage
Middleware for request validation and error handling
Comprehensive error classification system


Database Design

MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
Well-defined schemas with validation
Proper indexing for performance
Relationship management between collections


DevOps & Deployment

Docker and Docker Compose configuration
Nginx for static file serving and API proxying
Environment-specific configuration
CI/CD workflow templates



Structure Highlights
The project is organized into logical directories for clarity:

Frontend: Components, contexts, pages, services
Backend: Controllers, models, routes, middleware
Shared: Common types and utilities
Docker: Configuration for containerization
Configuration: Environment variables and settings

Each file contains detailed comments explaining its purpose and functionality, making the codebase easy to understand and extend.
You can download the artifact for a complete reference, including all the implementation details, configuration files, and testing setup.
