Frontend: Components, contexts, pages, services
Backend: Controllers, models, routes, middleware
Shared: Common types and utilities
Docker: Configuration for containerization
Configuration: Environment variables and settings

Each file contains detailed comments explaining its purpose and functionality, making the codebase easy to understand and extend.
